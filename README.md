Looking back on my time in software development, I've picked up several important habits that help make my programs both reliable and secure. One of the most crucial is validation. This means I set up strict rules in my code to ensure all data is correctly formatted before it gets processed. Doing this helps avoid mistakes and protects against security threats like data breaches. For example, in my projects, I’ve built methods into my classes that verify data is valid before moving forward. Testing is another essential part of my workflow. By creating unit tests, like the ones I wrote in my ContactServiceTest class, I can make sure each function behaves as it should. This includes not just the typical use cases but also those tricky edge cases, which keeps the software stable and reliable in different situations. Regular testing is key to catching problems early. Understanding what users need is also a top priority for me, and nothing beats direct interaction for that. I frequently gather feedback from users, which helps shape new features and improve existing ones. For instance, the ability to add, update, and delete contact details came directly from what users requested. Keeping the software design straightforward and user-friendly, as I did with the ContactService interfaces, makes the software easier for everyone to use and enhances their overall experience. When designing software, I lean heavily on object-oriented principles. This approach helps organize and simplify the code, making it easier to manage and scale up. You can see this in how I’ve set up classes like the Contact class, where all the contact information is neatly contained. Adhering to design principles like SOLID ensures that my software is not only functional but also easy to maintain and expand. I also continuously tweak and improve my designs based on user feedback and test results, which helps the software stay aligned with what users need and adapt to any changes. By consistently applying these practices and reflecting on my experiences, I make sure my software meets high standards for both functionality and security. This not only benefits the end-users but also helps me grow as a developer, enabling me to create software that truly meets real-world needs.
